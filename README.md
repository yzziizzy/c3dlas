Linear algebra functions and utilities for 3D rendering in C


This library exists because I couldn't find an MIT/BSD licensed C library for doing the math required in a OpenGL program. It's not optimized, extensive, or sophisticated. It is free and written in pure C.

C++ has become fat and ugly with age. Not that it was a 9 to start with...

ATLAS/CBLAS are an incomprehensible mess.

GPL, while a wonderful thing, is a bit heavy-handed for some basic math functions.

I firmly believe that such a library did not exist because most of the functionality was built in to older OpenGL versions. By the time OpenGL 3.3 came out most developers had converted to worshiping under the altar of OOP.



There are probably math bugs somewhere. If you find one, report it on github. Preferably include how to fix it to make my life easier.
